# FFT-Bin-Scrambler
An FFT bin scrambler developed with Max/MSP using pfft~ and gen~.

Bin scrambling is a spectral effect which randomly displace spectral content of every frequency band into other frequency bands
(in fft frequency bands are represented by "bins").
To run this patch you need to download the three files and keep them in the same folder. 

TODO: 
rescale control number for the gen~ delay in a way which relates to the amount of frames of the pfft~ object
